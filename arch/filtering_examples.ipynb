As historians turn to study this period and beyond, they will encounter a historical record that is radically different from what has ever existed before. Old websites, social media, blogs, photographs, and videos are all part of the massive quantities of digital information that technologists, librarians, archivists, and organizations such as the Internet Archive have been collecting for the past three decades. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Niels Brügger and Ian Milligan, editorsDecember 2018 SAGE SAGE Handbook of Web History The SAGE Handbook of Web History marks the first comprehensive review of this subject to date. Its editors emphasise the two different forms of its study: the use of the web as an historical resource, and the web as an object of study in its own right. Bringing together all the existing knowledge of the field, with an interdisciplinary focus and an international scope, this is an incomparable resource for historians and students alike. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Shawn Graham, Ian Milligan, and Scott WeingartNovember 2015 Imperial College Press Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian’s Macroscope The Digital Humanities have flourished at a moment when digital big data is becoming easily available. Yet there is a gap in the scholarly literature on the ways these data can be explored to construct cultural heritage knowledge, for both research and in our teaching and learning. We are on the cusp of needing to grasp big data approaches to do our work, whether it’s understanding the underlying algorithms at work in our search engines, or needing to design and use our own tools to process comparatively large amounts of information. This book fills that gap, and in its live-writing approach, will set the direction for the conversation into the future. DOI Publisher Site Companion Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads July 2014 University of British Columbia Press Rebel Youth: 1960s Labour Unrest, Young Workers, and New Leftists in English Canada While university-based activists combined youth culture with a new brand of radicalism to form the New Left, young workers were pressing for wildcat strikes and defying their aging union leaders in a wave of renewed militancy that swept the country. In Rebel Youth, Ian Milligan looks at these converging currents, demonstrating convincingly how they were part of a single youth phenomenon. With no fewer than seventy interviews complementing the extensive use of archival records, this book reveals a youth current that, despite regional differences, spanned an intellectual network from Halifax to Victoria that read the same publications, consulted the same thinkers, and found inspiration in the same shared ideas.

Principal Investigator (w/ Nick Ruest and William J. Turkel) Recent Courses HIST 216: A Long History of the Internet Department of History, University of Waterloo May 2020 – Aug 2020 The Internet has enabled global connection on an unprecedented level. To live and innovate in a society dominated by network communications requires understanding from where we have come. Yet, as Google executives Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen have noted, “the Internet is among the few things humans have built that they don’t totally understand.” (Schmidt and Cohen) While the technological story of the rise of the Internet and the Web today is important – our course touches on early computing, theories of hypertext, the ARPANET, and the networking revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s – the longer human story is equally critical. How has the concept of information evolved? How has print media emerged and evolved? How have humans communicated over time and space? How have common standards evolved, allowing people across the globe to communicate with each other? Previously taught Winter 2020, Fall 2018 and Winter 2018.See course page ARTS 490: Socio-Cultural Implications of Artificial Intelligence Global Governance Program, University of Waterloo Jan 2019 – Apr 2019 We have seen exponential growth in the automation of jobs, from the manufacturing to the service sector, and the consequent transformations of our everyday lives, including the displacement of human labour. We are also witness to new cultural forms ranging from gaming devices to companion robots.

Ethical Considerations for Providing Access to GeoCities and Other Historical Digital Collections | Ian Milligan Search Ian Milligan Home Posts Books Projects Courses Talks/Events Contact CV New Paper: We Could, but Should We? Ethical Considerations for Providing Access to GeoCities and Other Historical Digital Collections Last updated on Mar 31, 2020 1 min read Jimmy Lin, Douglas W. Oard, Nick Ruest, Katie Shilton, and myself recently published a new paper: “We Could, but Should We? Ethical Considerations for Providing Access to GeoCities and Other Historical Digital Collections.” It would have been presented at CHIIR 2020 in Vancouver, but alas, it was cancelled admist the general wave of COVID-19 conference cancellations. The paper is available here as a pre-print, however, as well as in the ACM Digital Library. Abstract: We live in an era in which the ways that we can make sense of our past are evolving as more artifacts from that past become digital. At the same time, the responsibilities of traditional gatekeepers who have negotiated the ethics of historical data collection and use, such as librarians and archivists, are increasingly being sidelined by the system builders who decide whether and how to provide access to historical digital collections, often without sufficient reflection on the ethical issues at hand. It is our aim to better prepare system builders to grapple with these issues. This paper focuses discussions around one such digital collection from the dawn of the web, asking what sorts of analyses can and should be conducted on archival copies of the GeoCities web hosting platform that dates to 1994.

As historians turn to study this period and beyond, they will encounter a historical record that is radically different from what has ever existed before. Old websites, social media, blogs, photographs, and videos are all part of the massive quantities of digital information that technologists, librarians, archivists, and organizations such as the Internet Archive have been collecting for the past three decades. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Niels Brügger and Ian Milligan, editorsDecember 2018 SAGE SAGE Handbook of Web History The SAGE Handbook of Web History marks the first comprehensive review of this subject to date. Its editors emphasise the two different forms of its study: the use of the web as an historical resource, and the web as an object of study in its own right. Bringing together all the existing knowledge of the field, with an interdisciplinary focus and an international scope, this is an incomparable resource for historians and students alike. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Shawn Graham, Ian Milligan, and Scott WeingartNovember 2015 Imperial College Press Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian’s Macroscope The Digital Humanities have flourished at a moment when digital big data is becoming easily available. Yet there is a gap in the scholarly literature on the ways these data can be explored to construct cultural heritage knowledge, for both research and in our teaching and learning. We are on the cusp of needing to grasp big data approaches to do our work, whether it’s understanding the underlying algorithms at work in our search engines, or needing to design and use our own tools to process comparatively large amounts of information. This book fills that gap, and in its live-writing approach, will set the direction for the conversation into the future. DOI Publisher Site Companion Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads July 2014 University of British Columbia Press Rebel Youth: 1960s Labour Unrest, Young Workers, and New Leftists in English Canada While university-based activists combined youth culture with a new brand of radicalism to form the New Left, young workers were pressing for wildcat strikes and defying their aging union leaders in a wave of renewed militancy that swept the country. In Rebel Youth, Ian Milligan looks at these converging currents, demonstrating convincingly how they were part of a single youth phenomenon. With no fewer than seventy interviews complementing the extensive use of archival records, this book reveals a youth current that, despite regional differences, spanned an intellectual network from Halifax to Victoria that read the same publications, consulted the same thinkers, and found inspiration in the same shared ideas.

Principal Investigator (w/ Nick Ruest and William J.

To live and innovate in a society dominated by network communications requires understanding from where we have come. Yet, as Google executives Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen have noted, “the Internet is among the few things humans have built that they don’t totally understand.” (Schmidt and Cohen) While the technological story of the rise of the Internet and the Web today is important – our course touches on early computing, theories of hypertext, the ARPANET, and the networking revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s – the longer human story is equally critical. How has the concept of information evolved? How has print media emerged and evolved? How have humans communicated over time and space? How have common standards evolved, allowing people across the globe to communicate with each other? Previously taught Winter 2020, Fall 2018 and Winter 2018.See course page ARTS 490: Socio-Cultural Implications of Artificial Intelligence Global Governance Program, University of Waterloo Jan 2019 – Apr 2019 We have seen exponential growth in the automation of jobs, from the manufacturing to the service sector, and the consequent transformations of our everyday lives, including the displacement of human labour. We are also witness to new cultural forms ranging from gaming devices to companion robots. It’s clear then that the socio-cultural and political impacts of such trends deserve our attention – as students, scholars, policy makers, and practitioners.See course page Recent & Upcoming Talks/Events For a full list of talks and presentations, please see my CV.

Ethical Considerations for Providing Access to GeoCities and Other Historical Digital Collections Last updated on Mar 31, 2020 1 min read Jimmy Lin, Douglas W. Oard, Nick Ruest, Katie Shilton, and myself recently published a new paper: “We Could, but Should We? Ethical Considerations for Providing Access to GeoCities and Other Historical Digital Collections.” It would have been presented at CHIIR 2020 in Vancouver, but alas, it was cancelled admist the general wave of COVID-19 conference cancellations. The paper is available here as a pre-print, however, as well as in the ACM Digital Library. Abstract: We live in an era in which the ways that we can make sense of our past are evolving as more artifacts from that past become digital. At the same time, the responsibilities of traditional gatekeepers who have negotiated the ethics of historical data collection and use, such as librarians and archivists, are increasingly being sidelined by the system builders who decide whether and how to provide access to historical digital collections, often without sufficient reflection on the ethical issues at hand. It is our aim to better prepare system builders to grapple with these issues. This paper focuses discussions around one such digital collection from the dawn of the web, asking what sorts of analyses can and should be conducted on archival copies of the GeoCities web hosting platform that dates to 1994.

As historians turn to study this period and beyond, they will encounter a historical record that is radically different from what has ever existed before. Old websites, social media, blogs, photographs, and videos are all part of the massive quantities of digital information that technologists, librarians, archivists, and organizations such as the Internet Archive have been collecting for the past three decades. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Niels Brügger and Ian Milligan, editorsDecember 2018 SAGE SAGE Handbook of Web History The SAGE Handbook of Web History marks the first comprehensive review of this subject to date. Its editors emphasise the two different forms of its study: the use of the web as an historical resource, and the web as an object of study in its own right. Bringing together all the existing knowledge of the field, with an interdisciplinary focus and an international scope, this is an incomparable resource for historians and students alike. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Shawn Graham, Ian Milligan, and Scott WeingartNovember 2015 Imperial College Press Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian’s Macroscope The Digital Humanities have flourished at a moment when digital big data is becoming easily available. Yet there is a gap in the scholarly literature on the ways these data can be explored to construct cultural heritage knowledge, for both research and in our teaching and learning. We are on the cusp of needing to grasp big data approaches to do our work, whether it’s understanding the underlying algorithms at work in our search engines, or needing to design and use our own tools to process comparatively large amounts of information. This book fills that gap, and in its live-writing approach, will set the direction for the conversation into the future. DOI Publisher Site Companion Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads July 2014 University of British Columbia Press Rebel Youth: 1960s Labour Unrest, Young Workers, and New Leftists in English Canada While university-based activists combined youth culture with a new brand of radicalism to form the New Left, young workers were pressing for wildcat strikes and defying their aging union leaders in a wave of renewed militancy that swept the country. In Rebel Youth, Ian Milligan looks at these converging currents, demonstrating convincingly how they were part of a single youth phenomenon. With no fewer than seventy interviews complementing the extensive use of archival records, this book reveals a youth current that, despite regional differences, spanned an intellectual network from Halifax to Victoria that read the same publications, consulted the same thinkers, and found inspiration in the same shared ideas. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Current Digital Projects Archives Unleashed Archives Unleashed aims to make petabytes of historical internet content accessible to scholars and others interested in researching the recent past. Supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, we are developing web archive search and data analysis tools to enable scholars, librarians and archivists to access, share, and investigate recent history since the early days of the World Wide Web.

Co-Investigator (grant led by Zhiwu Xie at Virginia Tech) A Longitudinal Analysis of the Canadian World Wide Web as a Historical Resource, 1996-2014 This project will help train highly-qualified personnel (HQP) in the humanities to prepare for the digital deluge that is already affecting our profession. It was among the first attempts to harness data in ways that will enable present and future historians to usefully access, interpret, and curate masses of born-digital primary sources. Principal Investigator (w/ Nick Ruest and William J. Turkel) Recent Courses HIST 216: A Long History of the Internet Department of History, University of Waterloo May 2020 – Aug 2020 The Internet has enabled global connection on an unprecedented level. To live and innovate in a society dominated by network communications requires understanding from where we have come. Yet, as Google executives Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen have noted, “the Internet is among the few things humans have built that they don’t totally understand.” (Schmidt and Cohen) While the technological story of the rise of the Internet and the Web today is important – our course touches on early computing, theories of hypertext, the ARPANET, and the networking revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s – the longer human story is equally critical. How has the concept of information evolved? How has print media emerged and evolved? How have humans communicated over time and space? How have common standards evolved, allowing people across the globe to communicate with each other? Previously taught Winter 2020, Fall 2018 and Winter 2018.See course page ARTS 490: Socio-Cultural Implications of Artificial Intelligence Global Governance Program, University of Waterloo Jan 2019 – Apr 2019 We have seen exponential growth in the automation of jobs, from the manufacturing to the service sector, and the consequent transformations of our everyday lives, including the displacement of human labour. We are also witness to new cultural forms ranging from gaming devices to companion robots. It’s clear then that the socio-cultural and political impacts of such trends deserve our attention – as students, scholars, policy makers, and practitioners.See course page Recent & Upcoming Talks/Events For a full list of talks and presentations, please see my CV.

Supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, we are developing web archive search and data analysis tools to enable scholars, librarians and archivists to access, share, and investigate recent history since the early days of the World Wide Web. Growing out of a series of datathons held at the University of Toronto, Library of Congress, Internet Archive, and the British Library, our team recognized the need for better analytics tools, community infrastructure, and accessible web archival interfaces. The three-year Archives Unleashed project has three major thrusts: The project will build a software toolkit that applies modern big data analytics infrastructure to scholarly analysis of web archives. The toolkit will be deployed in a cloud-based environment that will provide a one-stop portal for scholars to ingest their Archive-It collections and execute a number of analyses with the click of a mouse. Finally, datathons will build a cohesive and sustainable user community by bringing the core project team members together with librarians, archivists, and other interested researchers. Project Team Ian Milligan is associate professor of history at the University of Waterloo. Since 2012, he has been engaged in building tools, infrastructure, and frameworks to facilitate the historical use of web archives.

Oh wait, there’s a portal for that: the Archives Unleashed Cloud. The Archives Unleashed Cloud is an open source cloud-based analysis tool that helps researchers and scholars conduct web archive analysis. It supports the priorities of accessibility and usability of web archives by providing users a web-based front end to access the Archives Unleashed Toolkit. It has been primarily developed by our project co-investigator and developer, Nick Ruest. You can use the Cloud (for free) at http://cloud.archivesunleashed.org Functionalities The Cloud has a clean and easy-to-use modern interface. The best part is that you do not need to know how to code, which in turn supports the increased accessibility of working with web archives. Core features of the Archives Unleashed Cloud include: Syncing Archive-It collections; Ingesting Archive-It collections via WASAPI to the Cloud; Creating a network graph, domain distribution list, full text, and full text by domain derivatives, and making each available for download; Providing an in-browser network diagram to see major nodes and connections within your collection. In addition, our documentation offers guidance on how to get the Cloud up and running, as well as how to use some of its features. A Guided Tour of the Archives Unleashed Cloud Let’s take a tour of how the Cloud works. Below you will find a video tour of the Archives Unleashed Cloud, followed by a brief overview of what you can expect when working with the platform. Once a user signs up to cloud.archivesunleashed.org, they enter their Archive-It credentials, which are salted and encrypted. Those credentials are then used to sync their Archive-It collections with the Cloud using Archive-It’s WASAPI endpoint. This is done as a background job, and once it is complete, it emails the user to let them know that their Archive-It collections are synced and available for further analysis. The main collections screen provides some basic information about each collection: title, if the collection has been analyzed in the Cloud yet, if it is publicly available (in Archive-It), the number of ARC/WARCs in the collection, and the size of the collection. You can see this below! From the main collections screen, users can select a specific collection to download, which will trigger a number of background jobs. The first job uses data gathered from the WASAPI endpoint to download and verify each ARC/WARC file to our Archives Unleashed Cloud instance. Once the entire collection is downloaded, an automatic email is generated to notify the user that the collection has been downloaded, and analysis will begin. The analysis process then triggers an Apache Spark job and uses AUT to create a basic set of derivatives: A GEXF file which you can load with Gephi. It has a basic layout courtesy of our GraphPass program, which allows you to see major nodes and communities in the network; A GraphML file which you can load with Gephi. It does not have any basic layouts or transformations, requiring you to do so manually. You can use GraphPass to provide layout if you wish to add that feature to your file; A CSV file that explains the distribution of domains within the web archive; A CSV file that contains the text extracted from HTML documents within the web archive. You can find the crawl date, full URL, and the plain text of each page within the file; A ZIP file that contains the plain text extracted from HTML documents within the web archive, arranged by each domain. Within this ZIP you will have a series of text files, each containing the full text of a top-ten domain. If you are curious about what you can do with these files, see the Archives Unleashed Cloud Derivative Files learning guide. Here is a completed collection page: In addition, we use GraphPass to help to create a simple network visualization powered by Sigma js on the collection page. Sigma is a JavaScript library that assists in drawing and displaying graphs. GraphPass produces visualization-related data in the network files such as color, position and size based on common social network algorithms. In the networks each node (dot) represents a domain (i.e. all of the URLs within a domain such as “yorku.ca” or “newyorktimes.com”) and each edge (line) represents a link from one node to another. Users can explore and interact with the network using the helper buttons in the top left corner of the network window. Full Screen - opens up the network to full screen for easier interaction Zoom in/out - zooms the camera into the network and away from it Refresh - brings the network diagram back to its original state Scale up and scale down - allows users to see more or less node labels in the network A few cautionary notes on “scale up” and “scale down” are in order. With website networks, some sites have so many links compared to the others, that they obscure everything else. The Archives Unleashed Cloud’s scale-up feature uses logarithmic transformation to make the graph a bit easier to read. For example, six nodes with size values 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 1,000,000,000 can be transformed using a base 10 logarithm to produce new sizes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, & 9, making the node sizes much closer together in size. A logarithm is a mathematical expression used to deal with non-normal distributed data (like networks). It is created by giving a base number an exponent, which is then multiplied by itself, to create factor increments, rather than equal amount increments, between data points. This is important as it will allow for data points to be more evenly distributed with minimal influence on data accuracy and integrity. You can further interact with the hyperlink diagram by hovering over any node to highlight its immediate connections to other nodes. The arrow on each line indicates the direction of connection, for instance, in the image below, we see an arrow connecting two nodes and reveals that townyarmouth.ca has a link to the atlantic.ctvnews.ca domain. Future development will focus on filtering further down on a collection, and integrating the new DataFrame functionality we’re adding to AUT via a JDBC connector. Can I try it out? Currently, anyone with an Archive-It subscription can take the Cloud for a spin. Please just come over to http://cloud.archivesunleashed.org and give it a try. The Archives Unleashed Cloud is an open source project, you can view the codebase here. Although it is tied closely to the canonical instance running at http://cloud.archivesunleashed.org, it can also be run as a standalone project on your own server, desktop, or laptop! That said, our primary focus is on the canonical instance that we are hosting. However, if there is interest in generalizing aspects of the project, let us know and we can collaborate and figure out how to make it happen.

This is a hands-on introductory workshop with the Archives Unleashed Toolkit and Archives Unleashed Jupyter Notebooks. No existing technical knowledge is needed, and we will be aiming this at beginner and intermediate users alike. This workshop is being held on Tuesday, June 18th from 14:00-17:30 in room BG2 0.02 at the “Web that Was: Archives, Traces, Reflections” conference. Workshop Schedule Time Content 1400 - 1410 Introductions, Getting Settled 1410 - 1430 Introduction to the Archives Unleashed Toolkit (and related project) 1430 - 1530 Hands-on with the Archives Unleashed Toolkit, Gephi, etc. 1530 - 1600 Coffee Break 1600 - 1630 More Advanced Analytics (DataFrames, etc.) 1630 - 1715 Digging into WARCs with Jupyter Notebooks 1715 - 1730 Wrap Up Jupyter Notebooks You can run the Jupyter Notebooks in your browser at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/archivesunleashed/auk-notebooks/master. Have fun! Homework What should you bring? If you want to dig into WARCs yourself, you’ll need a laptop. If not, we will be working through exercises collectively, so you are more than welcome to participate in that manner too. If you are planning to participate in the hands-on components, to reduce load on the conference WiFi we would also like you to do the following homework: Installing Docker for Windows or Mac: https://archivesunleashed.org/aut/docker-install/ Please install Anaconda Distribution for your platform: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/. If you are versed on the command line, try installing our Notebooks using the instructions under Local (Anaconda) here: https://github.com/archivesunleashed/auk-notebooks. If not, don’t worry! Finally, please download and install Gephi for your platform: https://gephi.org. While we will provide sample data as part of the workshop, you may want to try it out with your own data. If you have some small WARCs you can bring those, or alternatively you can crawl a few websites with https://webrecorder.io and export the WARC(s). Questions? If you have any questions, please contact Nick Ruest or Ian Milligan.

The sheer amount of cultural information that is generated and, crucially, preserved every day in electronic form, presents exciting new opportunities for researchers. Much of this information is captured within web archives. Web archives often contain hundreds of billions of web pages, ranging from individual homepages and social media posts, to institutional websites. These archives offer tremendous potential for social scientists and humanists, and the questions research may pose stretch across a multitude of fields. Scholars broaching topics dating back to the mid-1990s will find their projects enhanced by web data. Moreover, scholars hoping to study the evolution of cultural and societal phenomena will find a treasure trove of data in web archives. In short, web archives offer the ability to reconstruct large-scale traces of the relatively recent past. With the latest release of the Archives Unleashed Toolkit (AUT), the project team will be hosting a series of four datathons for archivists, researchers, librarians, computer scientists, and others to collaboratively work with web collections and explore cutting-edge research tools through hands on experience. The Archives Unleashed Project is pleased to announce the first datathon will take place at the University of Toronto Robarts Library, 26-27 April 2018. This event will bring together a small group of approximately 15 participants to experiment with the newest release of AUT (Archives Unleashed Toolkit) and the Archives Unleashed Cloud, and to kick-off collaboratively inspired research projects. Participants will have access to analytics software and specialists, and will be exposed to the process of working with web archive files at scale.

As historians turn to study this period and beyond, they will encounter a historical record that is radically different from what has ever existed before. Old websites, social media, blogs, photographs, and videos are all part of the massive quantities of digital information that technologists, librarians, archivists, and organizations such as the Internet Archive have been collecting for the past three decades. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Niels Brügger and Ian Milligan, editorsDecember 2018 SAGE SAGE Handbook of Web History The SAGE Handbook of Web History marks the first comprehensive review of this subject to date. Its editors emphasise the two different forms of its study: the use of the web as an historical resource, and the web as an object of study in its own right. Bringing together all the existing knowledge of the field, with an interdisciplinary focus and an international scope, this is an incomparable resource for historians and students alike. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Shawn Graham, Ian Milligan, and Scott WeingartNovember 2015 Imperial College Press Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian’s Macroscope The Digital Humanities have flourished at a moment when digital big data is becoming easily available. Yet there is a gap in the scholarly literature on the ways these data can be explored to construct cultural heritage knowledge, for both research and in our teaching and learning. We are on the cusp of needing to grasp big data approaches to do our work, whether it’s understanding the underlying algorithms at work in our search engines, or needing to design and use our own tools to process comparatively large amounts of information. This book fills that gap, and in its live-writing approach, will set the direction for the conversation into the future. DOI Publisher Site Companion Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads July 2014 University of British Columbia Press Rebel Youth: 1960s Labour Unrest, Young Workers, and New Leftists in English Canada While university-based activists combined youth culture with a new brand of radicalism to form the New Left, young workers were pressing for wildcat strikes and defying their aging union leaders in a wave of renewed militancy that swept the country. In Rebel Youth, Ian Milligan looks at these converging currents, demonstrating convincingly how they were part of a single youth phenomenon. With no fewer than seventy interviews complementing the extensive use of archival records, this book reveals a youth current that, despite regional differences, spanned an intellectual network from Halifax to Victoria that read the same publications, consulted the same thinkers, and found inspiration in the same shared ideas.

Principal Investigator (w/ Nick Ruest and William J. Turkel) Recent Courses HIST 216: A Long History of the Internet Department of History, University of Waterloo May 2020 – Aug 2020 The Internet has enabled global connection on an unprecedented level. To live and innovate in a society dominated by network communications requires understanding from where we have come. Yet, as Google executives Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen have noted, “the Internet is among the few things humans have built that they don’t totally understand.” (Schmidt and Cohen) While the technological story of the rise of the Internet and the Web today is important – our course touches on early computing, theories of hypertext, the ARPANET, and the networking revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s – the longer human story is equally critical. How has the concept of information evolved? How has print media emerged and evolved? How have humans communicated over time and space? How have common standards evolved, allowing people across the globe to communicate with each other?

We are also witness to new cultural forms ranging from gaming devices to companion robots. It’s clear then that the socio-cultural and political impacts of such trends deserve our attention – as students, scholars, policy makers, and practitioners.See course page Recent & Upcoming Talks/Events For a full list of talks and presentations, please see my CV.

Ethical Considerations for Providing Access to GeoCities and Other Historical Digital Collections | Ian Milligan Search Ian Milligan Home Posts Books Projects Courses Talks/Events Contact CV New Paper: We Could, but Should We? Ethical Considerations for Providing Access to GeoCities and Other Historical Digital Collections Last updated on Mar 31, 2020 1 min read Jimmy Lin, Douglas W. Oard, Nick Ruest, Katie Shilton, and myself recently published a new paper: “We Could, but Should We? Ethical Considerations for Providing Access to GeoCities and Other Historical Digital Collections.” It would have been presented at CHIIR 2020 in Vancouver, but alas, it was cancelled admist the general wave of COVID-19 conference cancellations. The paper is available here as a pre-print, however, as well as in the ACM Digital Library. Abstract: We live in an era in which the ways that we can make sense of our past are evolving as more artifacts from that past become digital. At the same time, the responsibilities of traditional gatekeepers who have negotiated the ethics of historical data collection and use, such as librarians and archivists, are increasingly being sidelined by the system builders who decide whether and how to provide access to historical digital collections, often without sufficient reflection on the ethical issues at hand. It is our aim to better prepare system builders to grapple with these issues. This paper focuses discussions around one such digital collection from the dawn of the web, asking what sorts of analyses can and should be conducted on archival copies of the GeoCities web hosting platform that dates to 1994.

As historians turn to study this period and beyond, they will encounter a historical record that is radically different from what has ever existed before. Old websites, social media, blogs, photographs, and videos are all part of the massive quantities of digital information that technologists, librarians, archivists, and organizations such as the Internet Archive have been collecting for the past three decades. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Niels Brügger and Ian Milligan, editorsDecember 2018 SAGE SAGE Handbook of Web History The SAGE Handbook of Web History marks the first comprehensive review of this subject to date. Its editors emphasise the two different forms of its study: the use of the web as an historical resource, and the web as an object of study in its own right. Bringing together all the existing knowledge of the field, with an interdisciplinary focus and an international scope, this is an incomparable resource for historians and students alike. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Shawn Graham, Ian Milligan, and Scott WeingartNovember 2015 Imperial College Press Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian’s Macroscope The Digital Humanities have flourished at a moment when digital big data is becoming easily available. Yet there is a gap in the scholarly literature on the ways these data can be explored to construct cultural heritage knowledge, for both research and in our teaching and learning. We are on the cusp of needing to grasp big data approaches to do our work, whether it’s understanding the underlying algorithms at work in our search engines, or needing to design and use our own tools to process comparatively large amounts of information. This book fills that gap, and in its live-writing approach, will set the direction for the conversation into the future. DOI Publisher Site Companion Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads July 2014 University of British Columbia Press Rebel Youth: 1960s Labour Unrest, Young Workers, and New Leftists in English Canada While university-based activists combined youth culture with a new brand of radicalism to form the New Left, young workers were pressing for wildcat strikes and defying their aging union leaders in a wave of renewed militancy that swept the country. In Rebel Youth, Ian Milligan looks at these converging currents, demonstrating convincingly how they were part of a single youth phenomenon. With no fewer than seventy interviews complementing the extensive use of archival records, this book reveals a youth current that, despite regional differences, spanned an intellectual network from Halifax to Victoria that read the same publications, consulted the same thinkers, and found inspiration in the same shared ideas.

Turkel) Recent Courses HIST 216: A Long History of the Internet Department of History, University of Waterloo May 2020 – Aug 2020 The Internet has enabled global connection on an unprecedented level. To live and innovate in a society dominated by network communications requires understanding from where we have come. Yet, as Google executives Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen have noted, “the Internet is among the few things humans have built that they don’t totally understand.” (Schmidt and Cohen) While the technological story of the rise of the Internet and the Web today is important – our course touches on early computing, theories of hypertext, the ARPANET, and the networking revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s – the longer human story is equally critical. How has the concept of information evolved? How has print media emerged and evolved? How have humans communicated over time and space? How have common standards evolved, allowing people across the globe to communicate with each other? Previously taught Winter 2020, Fall 2018 and Winter 2018.See course page ARTS 490: Socio-Cultural Implications of Artificial Intelligence Global Governance Program, University of Waterloo Jan 2019 – Apr 2019 We have seen exponential growth in the automation of jobs, from the manufacturing to the service sector, and the consequent transformations of our everyday lives, including the displacement of human labour. We are also witness to new cultural forms ranging from gaming devices to companion robots. It’s clear then that the socio-cultural and political impacts of such trends deserve our attention – as students, scholars, policy makers, and practitioners.See course page Recent & Upcoming Talks/Events For a full list of talks and presentations, please see my CV.

As historians turn to study this period and beyond, they will encounter a historical record that is radically different from what has ever existed before. Old websites, social media, blogs, photographs, and videos are all part of the massive quantities of digital information that technologists, librarians, archivists, and organizations such as the Internet Archive have been collecting for the past three decades. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Niels Brügger and Ian Milligan, editorsDecember 2018 SAGE SAGE Handbook of Web History The SAGE Handbook of Web History marks the first comprehensive review of this subject to date. Its editors emphasise the two different forms of its study: the use of the web as an historical resource, and the web as an object of study in its own right. Bringing together all the existing knowledge of the field, with an interdisciplinary focus and an international scope, this is an incomparable resource for historians and students alike. Publisher Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads Shawn Graham, Ian Milligan, and Scott WeingartNovember 2015 Imperial College Press Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian’s Macroscope The Digital Humanities have flourished at a moment when digital big data is becoming easily available. Yet there is a gap in the scholarly literature on the ways these data can be explored to construct cultural heritage knowledge, for both research and in our teaching and learning. We are on the cusp of needing to grasp big data approaches to do our work, whether it’s understanding the underlying algorithms at work in our search engines, or needing to design and use our own tools to process comparatively large amounts of information. This book fills that gap, and in its live-writing approach, will set the direction for the conversation into the future. DOI Publisher Site Companion Site Amazon.ca Amazon.com Google Books Goodreads July 2014 University of British Columbia Press Rebel Youth: 1960s Labour Unrest, Young Workers, and New Leftists in English Canada While university-based activists combined youth culture with a new brand of radicalism to form the New Left, young workers were pressing for wildcat strikes and defying their aging union leaders in a wave of renewed militancy that swept the country. In Rebel Youth, Ian Milligan looks at these converging currents, demonstrating convincingly how they were part of a single youth phenomenon. With no fewer than seventy interviews complementing the extensive use of archival records, this book reveals a youth current that, despite regional differences, spanned an intellectual network from Halifax to Victoria that read the same publications, consulted the same thinkers, and found inspiration in the same shared ideas.

Principal Investigator (w/ Nick Ruest and William J. Turkel) Recent Courses HIST 216: A Long History of the Internet Department of History, University of Waterloo May 2020 – Aug 2020 The Internet has enabled global connection on an unprecedented level. To live and innovate in a society dominated by network communications requires understanding from where we have come. Yet, as Google executives Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen have noted, “the Internet is among the few things humans have built that they don’t totally understand.” (Schmidt and Cohen) While the technological story of the rise of the Internet and the Web today is important – our course touches on early computing, theories of hypertext, the ARPANET, and the networking revolutions of the 1980s and 1990s – the longer human story is equally critical. How has the concept of information evolved? How has print media emerged and evolved? How have humans communicated over time and space? How have common standards evolved, allowing people across the globe to communicate with each other?

In the essay, he reviews History in the Age of Abundance alongside Niels Brügger and Ralph Schroeder’s 2017 edited collection The Web as History: Using Web Archives to Understand the Past and the Present. Happy to say that Summers has positive things to say about the two books overall! For me, this quote popped out: Two recently published books—one by Ian Milligan (2019) and one edited by Niels Brügger and Ralph Schroeder (2017)—provide essential guides to help answer the question of what web archives are by describing concrete, nonhypothetical examples of how social science and humanities researchers are using web archives today. For those who have participated in web archiving activity and pondered how the records would get used, and for those who are looking to get involved in web archiving but are not sure what it takes, these two books are essential reading. I was curious how the book would be received within the archives profession. I take pains to note that the “web archive” of a web archive doesn’t line up nicely with the understanding of an “archive” within the profession, but there’s inevitably slippage in my work. Summers’ conclusion of the essay is essential reading as well, as it points towards a lot of cutting-edge scholarship – as well as a nice link to Emily Maemura’s great bibliography. Anyways, you can read the full review here in HTML or as a downloadable PDF.

I wanted to make sure others had a chance to read it, as it is a great distillation of our work. It is part of a collection of Waterloo Stories, which are a wonderful way to learn about the top-notch research being done across Waterloo. Special shoutout to Sarah McTavish, who is finishing her PhD with me this year. Her masterful Three-Minute Thesis video is within the story (or here on YouTube), and well worth watching. Here’s the lede to the story: The internet’s cultural record has been growing at an unprecedented rate, accumulating hundreds of billions of webpages. Unless we have a way to retrieve those pages, that history could be lost. Enter Ian Milligan, a professor in the Department of History and an advocate of web archiving. He is exploring petabytes of cultural heritage data and making it accessible to the public. “Data is rapidly becoming the building blocks of our histories — more specifically the histories of the 1990s and 2000s. We need to establish ways to work with that information,” Milligan says. With the shift to remote learning and working amidst the COVID-19 crisis, most of our interactions are taking place in online environments, mediated through computer screens, and this includes news websites, social media websites like Twitter and Reddit and university webpages. Milligan presses, “The COVID-19 pandemic underscores just how important the web and web archives will be for historians trying to piece together this global event.” [Continue reading…] Ian Milligan Associate Professor of History Exploring how technology is transforming historical research. © 2020 · Powered by the Academic theme for Hugo.

My own keynote was entitled “You shouldn’t need to be a web historian to use web archives: Lowering barriers to access through community and infrastructure.” Here’s the abstract: If a researcher currently wants to use web archives at scale, they need to be a significant focus of their research activity — in other words, a web historian really can’t just dabble with these sources. Yet historians need to be able to draw on wide varieties of sources for their projects (from archival records to newspaper records to oral histories and beyond). In this talk, I explore how we are developing tools to lower these barriers so that a historian really could use web history data without a significant investment of time. I’ll begin by discussing the current situation of working with web archives, and then highlight the Archives Unleashed project, datathons, and other ways in which cultural organizations are making web archives accessible. You can watch it below. Don’t worry, the intro music is only about five-seconds long! I’ve also put all the slides if you just want to skim through them.

While SSHRC has a decent back end (I think I’m one of the only people who kinda likes SharePoint now), they do tend to provide the documents that need to be reviewed in a bunch of seperate documents, i.e.: App_Milligan_Ian.pdf Attach_Milligan_Ian_Description.pdf Attach_Milligan_Ian_References.pdf Attach_Milligan_Ian_Timelines.pdf CCV_App_Milligan_Ian.pdf Scale this up by the 11 or 12 proposals that you need to read, and suddenly, you’re working with 60 individual PDFs rather than just 12 nicely-packaged PDFs. As somebody who tends to move PDFs to my iPad to annotate there, this is a bit annoying. This isn’t just a SSHRC problem, of course. Until a few years ago, when reviewing graduate admissions, we would get four or five PDFs per applicant. Bash to the rescue. This MacOS command will turn all of the above into a nice PDF for review: \"\"/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py\"\" -o Milligan.pdf *Milligan*  This saved me a lot of headache, so maybe if it saves just one of you some headache, posting it here will be worth it too.
